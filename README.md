# Divergence Meter Project v2

This is the second iteration of the [Divergence Meter Project](https://github.com/waicool20/Divergence-Meter-Project) and another personal learning project, this time learning how to integrate Li-Ion batteries into a project, new electrical converter topologies, Rust Programming Language and IoT.

Hardware is mostly finalized and most of the work left to do is actually programming the thing to work like the first program along with IoT capabilities via Android companion app. README will remain brief until I actually finish working on this, stay tuned :)
